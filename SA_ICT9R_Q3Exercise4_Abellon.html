	<h2>Little Background:</h2>

	<p>Two weeks ago, my family and I flew to Thailand. It was fun walking around Thailand, from food streets to shrines to luxury malls, it was fantastic. But of course, I can't forget about the food experience. The food in Thailand were delicious, mainly their chicken, it literally tastes like Inasal and there fruit shakes are really tasty. No joke, after we dropped off our luggages from the hotel we ate out already.</p>

	<h2>Favorite Experience:</h2>

	<p>One of my favorite places I visited in Thailand is ICONSIAM. ICONSIAM is big luxurious mall known for bring near to a river and two areas, Sook Siam and IconLux. Sook Siam is all about the floating market, from clothing to street vendors to jewelry. IconLux is about the all the luxurious stores in ICONSIAM, for example, Gucci, Zara, Louis Vuitton, Hermes and more. Normally, people are attracted to stores and food from the mall but for me..it's toilets (Ma'am, pls don't judge me. I'm not weird). Every time I entered the mall's bathroom they always have a different design, one even had an automatic sliding door in the entrance! I rarely see those in malls. But still, after shopping we ate dinner at a dinner cruise, we sat on the upper level of the boat where you get to see the view with no windows. The food was delicious and after that we just took some more pictures before returning back to the hotel.</p>

	<h2>Additinonal Note:</h2>
	<p>If you are a K-Pop lover just like me, I would recommend you to visit Gift Channel for Fans, it's located in Siam Square after you exit Siam Paragon. They sell lightsticks, albums, and random merchandise. There is another K-Pop store I visited but I unfortunately forgot the name. Don't worry, I will update as soon as I found it. </p>
